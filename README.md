## Project Title: 

Mice Data Management System

## Tools: 

MySQL, Apache, PHP, JavaScript

## Background:

Dr. Terasa Lever's group in MU School of Medicine log the results of animal experiments with a traditional paper-based way, which makes searching and visualization of data very hard. What's more, the hand-written data is error-prone and hard to maintain. 

## Description:

A user-friendly web-based research data collection and management platform was developed using PHP/JavaScript with a MySQL database. This platform supports logging research data in text and video formats. The data can be visualized in different ways to help Dr. Lever's group identify patterns in the experiment results.
